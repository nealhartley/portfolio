                <h2>Hello, my name is Neal Hartley. I am a developer living and working in New Zealand, striving to create fantastic outcomes for businesses with my IT expertise.</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Victoria University of Wellington with Bachelors' in Computer Science, Political Science and Classical Studies. This broad range of study has given me the ability to approach my
                projects with a strong and diverse knowledge base.</p>
                <p>Back in New Zealand after a stint in the jungle (Papua New Guinea) I am on the move, with my skills, my girlfriend and 
                my puppy, to the Manawatu.</p>
                <p>While logged off you can find me walking my dog, at the basketball courts, at my desk drawing, or on my computer learning new skills.</p>
