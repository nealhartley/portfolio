                    <p>
                        Hi there, my name is Neal Hartley and I am a web developer and designer 
                        based in Wellington New Zealand.
                        I have Degrees in Computer Science, Classical Studies and Political Science. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The past few years I have spent time creating websites and experiences to 
                        help businessess and charity organisations to
                        reach their target audience this has been mainly through a mix of design and front 
                        end development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have recently been overseas doing volunteer work. This has inspired me to try and further my skills
                        as with better skills I can have a bigger impact in trying to help improve life for as many people as possible.
                    </p>

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>I have experience with multiple frameworks and different CMSs. 
                    But I believe having solid fundamentals makes the difference. 
                My key skills are my degree in Computer Science, the core skills needed for Web Development, 
                and also my experience in Customer service and volunteering with people.</p>
