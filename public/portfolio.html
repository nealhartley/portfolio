                    <h2>FORCERT - Volunteering Abroad</h2>
                    <p>For the last 3 months of 2018 I lived and worked in Papua New guinea.
                       I was at a point in my life where I wanted to use my skills
                       to give back to a good cause. I was a volunteer with an organisation called 
                       FORCERT. </p>

                    <p>Forcert is involved in enabling communities around Papua New Guinea 
                       to hold on to their land and create viable sustainable business while maintaining
                       the forests of Papua New Guinea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       For the 3 months I was in Papua New Guinea I spent my time visiting and working with Forcert
                       and their partner communities. I spent time living in communal settings and really getting to
                       understand what FORCERT is trying to achieve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since returning to New Zealand I have been Volunteering my time to constructing and updating 
                        their website. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Skills Used</h3>
                    <p>Development - The website was developed using the Wordpress CMS.</p> 
                    <p>Design - Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator were used to design the site and create assets.</p> 
                    <p>
                    While my technical skills
                    were a large part of why I was selected for this role, my soft skills were much more important
                    to VSA. In applying for this role I was up against people with more experience than me, but ultimately 
                    my attitude and willingness to experience the tougher side of Papua New Guinea won out.<p>

                    <p>I also took the opportunity to get involved in other worthwhile causes while
                    living there. I spent some of my time each week at a local poorly funded IT school.
                    While there I was able to teach web development and design and also taught students
                    how to fix common computer issues while also using these lessons to improve the schools 
                    resources by fixing computers they had that were experiencing these issues.</p>

                    <h2>Reids Trees</h2>
                    <p>When I first met Reids Trees they were an up and coming arboriculture business in the Wellington region.
                    At the time, Reid, the owner of Reids Trees, was working for his own business one or two days a week
                    and then contracting for another business the rest of the week. </p>

                    <p>Eager to improve the perfomance of his business Reid approached me and we worked together on
                    creating an online presence for Reids Trees. I am now happy to say that Reid is working for Reids Trees
                    Every day of the week and has more work than he can handle</p>

                    <h3>What we did</h3>
                    <p>
                        We begun with a long consultation and came to the conclusion that the best things for his business
                        would be to create a web presence. This involved creating both a web page and establishing a facebook page
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We realised quite quickly looking through Reid's current clients that most were of a certain demographic.
                        This demographic was less technically able so we decided together that usability was tantamount in
                        this project.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Skills Used</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Reids Trees is built using the Angular 2 framework. This involves using Javascript
                            HTML and CSS
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Design - Reid and I worked together to design this website with usability and
                            his budget in mind
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Client Consultation - For this project me and Reid spent a lot of time making sure we 
                            knew exactly what would offer him the best value.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            User Experience - while designing and building I spent time with some of Reid's clients testing
                            the experience of the site to ensure it would be usable for his clientele. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Deployment - This site is deployed on my custom server. I managed the deployment and 
                            configuration for this site.
                        </li>

                <h2>Academics Profile</h2>
                <p>
                    Like most of my clients Sebastian approached me with a problem. He was applying for 
                    a position as a lecturer at one of New Zealands largest universities and wanted to stand out.
                    A part of applying for this role he had to have an academic website describing his credentials 
                    and outlining his skills. Sebastian wanted his website to stand out and wanted to do it on a budget.
                </p>
                <h3>What we did</h3>
                <p>
                    We broke down the requirements for content and then divided this into logical sections.
                    He decided to embark on an iterative approach. The first iteration was purely HTML with all the content 
                    divided up into the sections he wanted. We then proceeded to do multiple iterations. Each iteration involving
                    adding styling and functionality he desired after each previous iteration. We continued to iterate until Sebastian
                    was happy with his site and also happy with the money he had spent.
                </p>

                                <h3>Skills Used</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Sebastian's profile is built using the Angular 2 framework. This involves using Javascript
                            HTML and CSS
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Design - This involved designing how each iteration would improve upon the last.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Client Consultation - With this iterative approach we had contact often. This was great as we 
                            were able to very clearly understand each other and make sure every change was in the right direction.
                        </li>

                <h2>BlackDot</h2>
                <p>
                    Blackdot was a small scale sound production studio when they approached me. The two owners and clear ideas of what
                    they wanted for their website and needed someone to transfer their vision from ideas to a full website.
                </p>
                <h3>What we Did</h3>
                <p>
                    Being Artists the duo from BlackDot wanted a completely bespoke site with custom scrolling and their music front 
                    front and center. Together we discussed how they would use the site and how the people they wanted to view their music would
                    interact with it. In the end we decided to do a single page site that got straight to the point, the music.
                </p>
                <h3>Skills Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Site is made using CSS, Javascript (JQuery) and HTML</li>
                    <li>Design - Blackdot had a lot of clear ideas on the aesthetic they wanted and ideas for individual features. 
                    My design work for this job was taking all their ideas and putting them together into something cohesive.</li>
                    <li>User Experience - We really wanted to take the user on a musical
                        journey. The site is a journey through the music and projects they are most proud of. They wanted this to be a
                        portfolio for people they had approached to view and were not interested in gaining 
                        work via people finding the website so we stripped away all the noise and clutter and focused on making an experience 
                        for these selected users.</li>

                <h2>PathStarters</h2>
                <p>Three people and I were selected, out of 100s of applicants, by the Ministry of Social Development to go 
                    through an accelerator. In this accelerator we were given a problem faced by the ministry and 
                    tried to innovate a solution. </p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>
                   As the teams developer I was in charge of anything computer related. I worked on setting up technical systems 
                   needed while we were developing ideas. I developed two websites for our team as we had a change of direction 
                   part way through and required a new site. Also I was in charge of making sure our ideas were ultimately implementable
                   and also designing how we would implement them. As a small team I also spent a lot of time wearing different hats,
                   pitching ideas to senior members of MSD, doing design, research and hosting interviews with the vulnerable 
                   population that our idea would be aimed at.
                </p>
                <h3>Skills Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public speaking - I pitched and presented our ideas and research to numerous teams from 
                        the Ministry of Social Development as well as other interested parties.</li>
                    <li>IT - For the team I set up online forms, automatic emailing systems, and any other technical systems needed.</li>
                    <li>Web Dev - Built two websites for the team using HTML, Javascript, CSS, Angular</li>
                    <li>Software Engineering - spent time doing technical documents and designing systems for our potential ideas</li>
                    <li>Research - Had to research and become knowledgeable in the area we were trying to develop a solution for.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>Our final pitch was for a life goals based app following the staircase approach to rehabilitation, aimed at supporting wellness in mental health
                for MSD service users and beneficiaries. Ultimately our idea went in front of cabinet, after being given the go ahead by the minister at the time.
                Unfortunately we were unsuccessful as one of the science advisors of the time did not like our idea. We ultimately 
                were not passed through cabinet and did receive funding. </p>
                <p>
                    Although disappointed by the result I gained a lot of experience from this role. I think this role made
                    me a more well rounded individual and gave me skills no other developer could bring to a role.
